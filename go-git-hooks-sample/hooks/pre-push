# Called by "git push" after it has checked the remote status, but before anything has been
# pushed. If this script exits with a non-zero status nothing will be pushed.
#
# Before usage git hook path needs to be set accordingly:
#	git config core.hooksPath hooks (folderName containing this script)
#
# This hook is called with the following parameters:
# 	$1 -- Name of the remote to which the push is being done
# 	$2 -- URL to which the push is being done
#
# If pushing without using a named remote those arguments will be equal.
#
# Information about the commits which are being pushed is supplied as lines to
# the standard input in the form:
#
#   <local ref> <local sha1> <remote ref> <remote sha1>
#
# You can use `git push --no-verify` to bypass this pre-push hook
